# ReadToUnlock

A simple WPF application for reading practice with configurable quotes. Initial idea was completely different so just ignore the name, this is a bad project anyways. I dont think half the shit works. Feel free to steal it or whatever.

## What it does
- Displays quotes for reading practice
- Supports English and Spanish quotes
- Lets you choose custom quote file locations
- Fullscreen reading mode

## Quick Start
1. **Download** the application
2. **Run** `Quote-Reader.exe`
3. **Click** "Start Reading" to begin
4. **Use Settings** to change quote file locations if needed

## Settings
- **File Settings**: Choose your own quote files
- **Browse**: Easy file selection with file picker
- **Validate**: Test if files are found correctly

## Files
- `english_quotes.json` - English quotes (included)
- `spanish_quotes.json` - Spanish quotes (included)
- Both files contain sample quotes you can customize

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or later
- .NET 8.0 runtime

## Troubleshooting
- Use **Debug** button in Reading Practice to see file locations
- Check **Settings** â†’ **Validate Files** to test quote files
- Debug window shows exact paths being used
